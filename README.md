# Explainably Forecasting Cyber Threats

# Phase 1
Collect data from the sources specified in the project report.

# Phase 2
Begin coding the base model.

# Phase 2.5
Implement SHAP into the model.

# Phase 3
Rigourously test the best neigbourhood of SHAP values in each feature.

# Phase 4
Ceate plots that predict the next 3 years of cyber attacks.
